Greetings! My name is raxter and if you are here, I've probably applied to a job with you! Do please go ahead and hire me.

Not convinced yet... so, I've made this repository to house code and systems examples to show that I actually am a programmer of 12+ years experience. 

A lot of included here are riffed off of or loosly based of ideas and concepts that have been used in actual titles. But all code here is original and my own.

[TODO] a list of features

[more important TODO] the features...

- Mutiscene-Area based Scene Streaming
  - Allows sets of scenes to be loaded in and out automatically based on player position.

  - Areas defined via scriptable objects
- Narrative and Logic Flow Timeline Controller
  - Allows for logic based flow within a unity Timeline
  - Logic defined by a signal-like
- Procedurally animated whale
  - Based off of To Be A Whale's whale controller, adapted for more fluid controls
  - 2 stage system of blended animations and a intermediate animation controller, that is then driven by a high level system.
- Scriptable Object based Composition Editor
  - Allows for scene objects to be moves and positioned into various compositions
  - Fully editable/composable in edit mode
