Greetings! My name is raxter and if you are here, I've probably applied to a job with you! Do please go ahead and hire me.

Not convinced yet... so, I've made this repository to house code and system's examples to show that I actually am a programmer of 12 years experience. 

A lot of this is loosly based of ideas and concepts that have been used in actual titles. But all code here is original and my own.

[TODO] a list of features

[more important TODO] the features...
